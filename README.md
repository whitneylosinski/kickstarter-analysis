# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performed an analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for successful crowdfunding campaigns, specifically looking at theater and play campaigns.  

The data showed that theater and play campaigns are relatively popular and successful campaigns compared to other categories on Kickstarter.  This can be seen in the pivot chart below.

When comparing starting dates to the level of success for theater campaigns, the graph below shows that the months of May and June have a greater success rate with success tapering off toward the end of the year.

Another trend discovered from the data is that failed play campaigns tend to have higher fundraising goals with the average goal of successful campaigns at $5,000 and the average goal of failed campaigns more than double that at $10,500.  However, the goal may not be the only factor in determining success, as the average pleged for failed campaigns was only $500 versus the average $5,600 pledged for successful campaigns.

Based on the findings from the data, When starting a new crowdfunding campaign for a play, I would recommend starting the campaign in May or June.
